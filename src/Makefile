# A sample Makefile for building Google Test and using it in user
# tests.  Please tweak it to suit your environment and project.  You
# may want to move it to your project's root directory.
#
# SYNOPSIS:
#
#   make [all]  - makes everything.
#   make TARGET - makes the given target.
#   make clean  - removes all files generated by make.

# Please tweak the following variable definitions as needed by your
# project, except GTEST_HEADERS, which you can use in your own targets
# but shouldn't modify.

# Where to find user code.
USER_DIR = .

CPPFLAGS += -lcrypto -lssl -lvirt -lvirt-qemu
# Flags passed to the C++ compiler.
CXXFLAGS += -g -Wall -Wextra -Wconversion -pthread -std=c++11

# All tests produced by this Makefile.  Remember to add new tests you
# created to the list.
TOOL = sevtool

# House-keeping build targets.

# Builds a sample test.  A test should link with either gtest.a or
# gtest_main.a, depending on whether it defines its own main()
# function.
